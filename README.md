# Neural Network Evolution Simulation

A simulation where foxes and rabbits evolve neural network "brains" through natural selection.

## Features
- Neural network brains for both predators and prey
- Genetic evolution with crossover and mutation
- Realistic breeding system with genders and pregnancy
- Real-time pygame visualization
- Energy management and predator-prey dynamics

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```bash
python main.py
python main.py
